## Artificial Intelligence

#### Game Theory

- [Othello AI](https://github.com/alexandreLamarre/Othello-Strategy-AI-Monte-Carlo-Search-Tree) - A python AI that implements game tree search algorithms (minimax, alphabeta) using Othello game logic. Only supported by Linux operating systems.
- [Go AI](https://github.com/alexandreLamarre/Go-AI-backend) - A flask backend that implements Go board logic with game search tree algorithms: minimax, alpha-beta and Monte Carlo with customizable heurisitcs.

#### Deep Learning

- [Deep Learning Go AI](https://github.com/alexandreLamarre/Go-AI-backend) A flask backend that implements Go board logic with a variety of neural networks & deep learning algorithms

#### Inference & Learning
- [Bayesian Networks](https://github.com/alexandreLamarre/Bayes-Networks) - A Bayesian Network Model coded in python, with some test examples drawn from medicine data.


## Computer Algebra
- [Computer Algebra System](https://github.com/alexandreLamarre/Computer-Algebra-System) A Computer Algebra System library written in C: implements symbolic & computational algebra.
- [Non Euclidean Computational Engine](https://github.com/alexandreLamarre/NE-web-engine) A computational engine that can interpret custom functions of any dimension & custom markov chains. It can perform symbolic optimization, differentiaion, integration and plotting on custom functions and simulate and find equilibrium distributions of markov chains.


## Data/Algorithm Visualization



- [Network Analysis](https://github.com/alexandreLamarre/Network-Algorithm-Visualization) - A webapp that visualizes step-by-step network analysis algorithms. It visuallizes the following classes of network problems: vertex coloring, edge coloring, minimum spanning trees, force directed layouts and spectral layouts. Force directed layouts implement industry standard algorithms while spectral layouts implement research standard algorithms.

- [Search Algorithm Visualizer]() - A web app that visualizes a variety of tree search algorithms including Breadth-First-Search, Depth-First-Search, A* star search and Greedy Best First Search, with interactible nodes and drawable obstacles.

- [Sort Algorithm Visualizer]() - A web app that visualizes a variety of sorting algorithms including: merge sort, quick sort, heapsort, timsort and more.
